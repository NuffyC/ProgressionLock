# ProgressionLock
A simple tshock plugin that deletes items based on the world progression. Original code by [Ozz](https://github.com/Ozz5581/AntiPlat)https://github.com/Ozz5581/AntiPlat
This plugin is suited for my server, so feel free to edit it to remove or add items.
I am very new to coding so i simply stumble my way through stuff to get things to work how i want em.

This plugin includes a new command called "/resetworldprogress" under the permission node "pbac.resetboss"
(May be laggy with alot of players)
